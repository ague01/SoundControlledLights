# sound-controlled-DMXlights

## Main purpose
Suppose you have a a bunch of led RGB lights that can controlled using DMX512 protocol and you have to set up a party with music and lights. You need an UDP to DMX512 gateway (I used the one produced by ADFweb) and no more.
This script will play all the songs for you and at the same time it will control lights following the sound frequencies.
